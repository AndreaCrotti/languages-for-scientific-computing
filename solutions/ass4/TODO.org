* TODO Write a Matlab function [[file:F2.m][F2]] that takes a matrix X as input and returns Y
  Trying to write elegant code 
  
* TODO Implement the function [[file:D.m][D]]
  
* TODO Use F or fft2 for recursive calls to F

* TODO Compare the implementation against fft2 for accuracy and speed

* TODO Write a function INC that takes as input a 2-dimensional array Spectr, and two integers m and n.

* TODO INC returns an (m×n) multiplot.

* TODO The (i,j)-th plot contains the 2D FFT of the (i,j)-th tile of Spectr, where Spectr is subdivided in (m×n) tiles.

* TODO Use the output of ifft2 (inverse 2D FFT) as the input for INC.

* TODO Use imread to load an image, and rgb2gray to create a b&w picture.

* TODO Use imshow to generate images. Pay attention to the second argument.

* TODO Use abs to go from complex to real data. Experiment with several values of m and n.
