Matrix A partitione and stored over 4 processors.

Instructions available are:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Y = get(var_name, j, tag)
#Asynchronous operation to the the variable $var_name from processor
#tagging the operation with $tag.
complete(tag)
# idle until the data transfer tagged is done
sync()
#pi idles until all processors have issued a sync

#+END_SRC

The main danger here is to lose many computation cycles waiting for processors to have finished.

So we need a strategy where the parallelism is maximized while maintaining the correctness is guaranteed.

Sum of matrices is not a difficult operation.
